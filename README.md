# Bone-Fracture-Detection

Overview

This project utilizes deep learning techniques to detect bone fractures in X-ray images. The model processes input images, applies image preprocessing, and classifies them as fractured or normal using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

#Features

Deep Learning-Based Detection: Utilizes a trained CNN model for fracture classification.

Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques.

User-Friendly Interface: Can be integrated into a web or desktop application for ease of use.

High Accuracy: Uses state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to ensure reliable predictions.

# Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

# Libraries:

TensorFlow/Keras (for model training and evaluation)

OpenCV (for image processing)

NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)
